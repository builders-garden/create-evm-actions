# Create Open Frames

The easiest way to get started with your Open Frame is by using `create-open-frames`. This CLI allows you to quickly start building a new Open Frame from one or more templates.

### Interactive

You can create a new Open Frame interactively by running:

```bash
# using npx
npx create-open-frames
# using npm
npm create open-frames
# using yarn
yarn create open-frames
# using pnpm
pnpm create open-frames
```

Follow the instructions to create your new Open Frame.

### Non Interactive

Coming soon.

## Templates

These are the templates that you can use to bootstrap your Open Frame:
